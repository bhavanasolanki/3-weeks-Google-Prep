9. https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-employees-to-be-invited-to-a-meeting/
    Great question it is solved by checking if in a component there is a cyclic dependency or interdependency. if cycle is there then length of cycle is max and if interdependency then a+b+2 where a is max length of branch from node1 and b is max length of branch from node2

MST - Prim's Algo & Krusals Algo. I prefer Prim's
1. https://leetcode.com/problems/find-critical-and-pseudo-critical-edges-in-minimum-spanning-tree/ Based on MST so critical edge are those whose removal from tree changes the mst value and psudo are those whose present or absence does not matter mst remains same.
